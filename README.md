You are a lone fighter searching for a challenge.. You are trapped in this realm of monsters and have to find an exit.
During this travel you have to fight monsters, archers, knights, avoid traps and use your dexterity and strength to jump from platform to platform and wall to wall.

There are also an item that looks like a green circle with a red cross that you can pick up to gain more health.
There is no limit to how much health you can gain, so be sure to collect as many as you can to make your
journey easier. Good luck!
